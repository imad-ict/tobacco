streamlit run enhanced_dashboard.py

streamlit run enhanced_dashboard_with_alerts.py
```

## When to Use Which Version

### Use Original Version When:
- Focused analysis of a single region
- Detailed meteorological analysis needed
- Prefer simpler, uncluttered interface

### Use Enhanced Version When:
- Managing multiple tobacco cultivation sites
- Need quick overview of all regional risks
- Want immediate visual alert status
- Coordinating district-wide operations

Both versions use the same weather data, risk calculations, and forecasting algorithms. The enhanced version simply adds the multi-district overview capability while preserving all original functionality.
