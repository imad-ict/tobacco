## ðŸ”¬ **Scientific Enhancements Implemented**

### 1. **Enhanced Dust Storm Risk Assessment**

#### **Core Improvements:**
- **Atmospheric Pressure Integration**: Low pressure systems (< 1000 hPa) now amplify dust storm risk
- **Visibility Confirmation**: Dust storms typically reduce visibility to < 5 km, used for risk validation
- **Dew Point Temperature Spread**: Large temperature-dew point gaps (> 12Â°C) indicate dry air favorable for dust uplift
- **Advanced False Positive Exclusion**: Multiple rules prevent incorrect alerts

#### **Technical Implementation:**
```python
# Pressure Amplifier
if pressure < 1000 and base_risk > 0:
    base_risk = min(4, base_risk + 1)  # +1 risk level
    if pressure < 995:  # Very low pressure
        base_risk = min(4, base_risk + 1)  # Additional +1 risk

# Visibility Confirmation
if visibility < 5000 and base_risk > 0:
    base_risk = min(4, base_risk + 1)  # Confirms dust conditions

# Dew Point Spread Analysis
temp_dew_spread = temp - dew_point
if temp_dew_spread > 12:  # Very dry air
    base_risk = min(4, base_risk + 1)

# False Positive Exclusion
if humidity > 70 or wind_speed < 3:
    base_risk = 0  # Conditions unfavorable for dust storms
```

#### **Agricultural Impact:**
- **Transplanting Stage**: 1.5x multiplier - Young plants extremely vulnerable
- **Harvest Period**: 1.8x multiplier - Critical for crop quality and yield
- **Leaf Maturation**: 1.6x multiplier - Affects final tobacco quality

### 2. **Enhanced Hailstorm Risk Assessment**

#### **Core Improvements:**
- **Atmospheric Pressure Integration**: Low pressure enhances convective storm development
- **CAPE Integration**: Convective Available Potential Energy is the best predictor of storm intensity
- **Temperature-Based Enhancement**: Higher temperatures increase convective potential
- **Comprehensive False Positive Exclusion**: Prevents alerts in unsuitable conditions

#### **Technical Implementation:**
```python
# Pressure Amplifier for Convective Storms
if pressure < 1000 and base_risk > 0:
    base_risk = min(4, base_risk + 1)
    if pressure < 995:  # Strong convective potential
        base_risk = min(4, base_risk + 1)

# CAPE Assessment (when available)
if cape > 2000:  # Very high convective energy
    base_risk = min(4, base_risk + 2)
elif cape > 1000:  # Moderate convective energy
    base_risk = min(4, base_risk + 1)

# Temperature Enhancement
if temp > 35:  # Extremely warm conditions
    base_risk = min(4, base_risk + 1)

# False Positive Exclusion
if clouds < 20 or temp < 15:
    base_risk = 0  # Insufficient conditions for hailstorm development
```

#### **Agricultural Impact:**
- **Flowering Stage**: 1.4x multiplier - Flower damage affects seed production
- **Leaf Maturation**: 1.6x multiplier - Physical damage reduces quality
- **Harvest Period**: 1.8x multiplier - Can cause complete crop loss

---

### 3. **Advanced False Positive Reduction**

#### **Dust Storm Exclusions:**
- **High Humidity Rule**: Humidity > 70% = No dust risk (dust unlikely in moist conditions)
- **Low Wind Rule**: Wind speed < 3 m/s = No dust risk (insufficient for dust uplift)
- **Stable Atmosphere Rule**: High clouds + low wind = Reduced risk (stable conditions)

#### **Hailstorm Exclusions:**
- **Low Cloud Rule**: Cloud cover < 20% = No hail risk (insufficient cloud development)
- **Cold Temperature Rule**: Temperature < 15Â°C = No hail risk (insufficient convective energy)
- **Dry Conditions Rule**: Low humidity + low clouds = Reduced risk
- **Weak Wind Shear Rule**: Very low wind in marginal conditions = Reduced risk
