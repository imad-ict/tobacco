## ⚠️ Enhanced Risk Assessment System

### Stage-Specific Risk Multipliers
The dashboard now applies scientifically-based vulnerability multipliers:

| Growth Stage | Multiplier | Rationale |
|--------------|------------|-----------|
| **Nursery** | 0.8x | Protected environment, lower field exposure |
| **Transplanting** | 1.5x | Establishment stress, highest vulnerability |
| **Vegetative** | 1.2x | Active growth, moderate sensitivity |
| **Flowering** | 1.4x | Reproductive stress, high sensitivity |
| **Topping** | 1.3x | Operational vulnerability, fresh cuts |
| **Maturation** | 1.6x | Quality critical, weather impacts value |
| **Harvest** | 1.8x | Maximum vulnerability, quality & yield critical |
| **Post-Harvest** | 0.6x | Minimal crop risk, field preparation |

### Advanced Risk Calculation
```python
# Example: Enhanced risk calculation
base_dust_risk = calculate_base_risk(wind_speed, humidity, pressure)
stage_multiplier = get_stage_multiplier(current_growth_stage)
final_risk = min(4, base_dust_risk * stage_multiplier)
```

## 🎯 Stage-Specific Risk Messaging

### Comprehensive Risk Communication
Each risk level now provides stage-specific guidance:

#### Example: Dust Risk During Harvest Period
- **Level 0**: "✅ No dust risk - Good harvesting conditions"
- **Level 1**: "⚠️ Low dust risk - Normal harvest operations"
- **Level 2**: "⚠️ Moderate dust risk - Protect harvested leaves"
- **Level 3**: "🚨 High dust risk - Delay harvest if possible"
- **Level 4**: "🚨 Severe dust risk - Suspend harvest operations"

#### Example: Rain Risk During Transplanting
- **Level 0**: "✅ No rain - Good transplanting conditions"
- **Level 1**: "🌧️ Light rain - Helpful for establishment"
- **Level 2**: "🌧️ Moderate rain - Monitor soil conditions"
- **Level 3**: "⚠️ Heavy rain - Delay transplanting operations"
- **Level 4**: "🚨 Severe rain - Postpone all transplanting"
