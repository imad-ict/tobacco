## ðŸŽ¯ Risk Logic Implementation

### Applied Risk Algorithms
**Dust Storm Risk:**
- Level 4 (Severe): Wind > 15 m/s + Humidity < 30%
- Level 3 (High): Wind > 10 m/s + Humidity < 35%
- Level 2 (Moderate): Wind > 7 m/s + Humidity < 40%
- Level 1 (Light): Wind > 4 m/s + Humidity < 50%

**Hail Storm Risk:**
- Level 4 (Severe): Temp > 25Â°C + Rain > 3mm + Clouds > 80% + Wind > 5 m/s
- Level 3 (High): Temp > 25Â°C + Rain > 2mm + Clouds > 60%
- Level 2 (Moderate): Rain > 1mm + Clouds > 40%
- Level 1 (Light): Rain > 0.5mm + Clouds > 20%

**Rain Risk:**
- Level 4 (Severe): Rain > 10mm/3h
- Level 3 (High): Rain > 6mm/3h
- Level 2 (Moderate): Rain > 3mm/3h
- Level 1 (Light): Rain > 0.5mm/3h
