# Active Context: Dashboard Development Phase

## Current Focus
Building a comprehensive Streamlit dashboard for weather risk assessment in tobacco cultivation, transforming the existing console-based weather monitoring script into an interactive web application.

## Immediate Tasks
1. **Dashboard Planning**: Design the complete dashboard structure and user interface
2. **Streamlit Implementation**: Convert existing weather logic into Streamlit components
3. **Risk Visualization**: Implement gauge meters and risk assessment displays
4. **Data Integration**: Enhance existing OpenWeatherMap API integration
5. **User Experience**: Create intuitive navigation and regional selection

## Recent Analysis
- Existing `code.py` contains solid foundation for weather data fetching and risk classification
- Current implementation covers 4 Pakistani regions with hourly/daily forecasts
- Risk classification logic exists for dust storms and hailstorms
- Need to add rain risk classification and enhance visualization

## Next Steps
1. Plan dashboard architecture and component layout
2. Create requirements.txt for dependencies
3. Implement main Streamlit dashboard with:
   - Header section with region selection
   - Current weather overview cards
   - Risk assessment gauges (0-4 scale)
   - Detailed weather forecast tables
   - Navigation tabs for different views
4. Enhance risk classification with tobacco-specific thresholds
5. Add visual elements (gauges, charts, color coding)

## Key Decisions
- Use Streamlit for rapid dashboard development
- Maintain existing OpenWeatherMap API integration
- Implement 0-4 risk scoring system with color coding
- Focus on tobacco cultivation specific messaging
- Ensure mobile-responsive design for field use

## Current Challenges
- Need to research Streamlit gauge components or alternatives
- Ensure real-time data updates without performance issues
- Balance information density with usability
- Implement proper error handling for API failures
