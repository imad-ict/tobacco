- **Functionality**: Toggles display of side-by-side temperature comparison card
- **Help Text**: Explains the purpose of comparing sensor data with model predictions

### 3. **Temperature Comparison Card**
- **Visual Design**: Gradient background with professional styling
- **Side-by-Side Display**: Current temperature vs next hour forecast
- **Difference Indicator**: Shows temperature difference with color coding
  - Green (≤2°C difference): Good agreement
  - Orange (>2°C difference): Notable variance

- **Tooltip**: Embedded explanation about data source differences

### 4. **Enhanced KPI Cards**
- **Current Temperature Card**: 
  - Custom styled card with green border (real-time indicator)
  - Enhanced labeling with sensor data explanation
  - Tooltip with detailed help text
- **Other Metrics**: Added help tooltips to all KPI cards for clarity
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between real-time and forecast data

### 5. **Comprehensive Disclaimers**
#### Overview Tab:
```
ℹ️ Data Sources: Current conditions are from real-time weather sensors. 
Forecast values are model predictions that may slightly differ from sensor 
readings due to update intervals and data sourcing methods.
```

#### Weather Details Tab:
```
📋 Data Source Information:
- Current readings are from real-time weather sensors
- Forecasted values are model predictions and may slightly differ from 
  real-time sensor data due to update intervals and data sourcing
```

#### Comprehensive Warning:
```
📝 Important Note: Current readings and forecasts may vary due to data 
refresh timing. Forecasts are generated by predictive weather models and 
represent estimates based on atmospheric conditions. Real-time sensor data 
provides actual measured values but may have slight delays in updates.
```

### 6. **Enhanced Forecast Tables**
- **Column Headers**: Updated to "Forecasted Temp (°C)" instead of "Temp (°C)"
- **Table Labels**: Added "📊 Hourly Forecast Table (Model Estimates)"
- **Clear Distinction**: Separate sections for current real-time data vs forecast data

### 7. **Improved Trend Analysis**
- **Chart Titles**: Updated to "Forecasted Temperature & Humidity Trend"
- **Annotations**: Added chart annotations explaining data source
- **Comparison Notes**: Shows current vs forecast temperature difference
- **Enhanced Summary**: Detailed explanation of trend data sources
