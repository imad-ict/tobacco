  - Level 4: Temp >25°C + Rain >3mm + Clouds >80% + Wind >5 m/s
  - Level 3: Temp >25°C + Rain >2mm + Clouds >60%
  - Level 2: Rain >1mm + Clouds >40%
  - Level 1: Rain >0.5mm + Clouds >20%

**🌧️ Rain Risk**
- **Algorithm**: Precipitation intensity over time periods
- **Thresholds**:
  - Level 4: >10mm in 3 hours (Severe flooding risk)
  - Level 3: >6mm in 3 hours (Heavy rain)
  - Level 2: >3mm in 3 hours (Moderate rain)
  - Level 1: >0.5mm in 3 hours (Light rain)
